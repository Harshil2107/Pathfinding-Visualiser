In the above gif, the algorithms shown are A* search, BFS, DFS and Dijkstras algorithm in that order.  
## Usage

Start by placing the start node, end node and the walls by left clicking a block on the screen, first left click places start, second left click places end and the reest place walls.  
The start, end and walls can also be removed by right clicking the block to be removed.  
Pressing space bar clears the screen.  

The visualizer has 4 algorithms that can be visualised :

Press 'a' for A* search.  
Press 'b' for BFS.  
Press 'c' for DFS.  
Press 'd' for Dijkstras algorithm.
